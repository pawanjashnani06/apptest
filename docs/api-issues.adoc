|`/id-verification/v2/parties/{partyId}/IDOCRExtractions`
|`POST`

* According to swagger docs it can get customer details from identity document image (passport, ID Card or ID Book) how should we match this to Smart ID and Green Book ID
* According to source code it can only scan `IdCard` or `IdBook` how should we match this to Smart ID and Green Book ID
* `partyId` seems to be a resource identifier. According to the `API` it must be provided by the client but it is not clear how it should be obtained.

|`/id-verification/v2/parties/{partyId}/facialRecognitionProfiles`
|`POST`
a|

* Same issue as for `OCR` endpoint - `partyId` seems to be a resource identifier provided by the client, but it is unclear how it should be obtained.
